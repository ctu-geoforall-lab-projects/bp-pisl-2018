	Cloud computing - the delivery of on-demand computing resources over a network (internet or intranet) -  is on the rise. Computing resources may may range from relatively simple (..) such as text editors to very complex software. They all share the same basic concept – the client only needs to provide input data, the process itself runs on a server and then returns the corresponding output data to the client.

Using cloud computing offers a way to gain new capabilities without investing in new hardware or software. It allows users to perform complex tasks without having to having deal with technical details of the process. It ensures better collaboration by allowing remote teams to use the same software. And as all resources are maintained by the service provider, usually the latest version of the software is available.


For the above mentioned and other reasons, cloud computing is frequently used in the field of geoinformation technology and GIS. It is most useful when it is clear to the client what they need to do and how to do it and they only lack the tools to perform the task. For example, the ESRI’s ArcGIS Online platform offers a wide selection of tools to choose from. These can be “rented” by the client and the task is then performed on the server. That way, the client gets the desired data without having to purchase (and learn to use) any desktop GIS application.

While the benefits of (cloud computing) are apparent, there is also another aspect of (it) that may not get much attention – the management of the data produced by such processes. The amount of data collected and used is increasing rapidly and so is the number of processes that are being shared on a network. Naturally, the amount of data derived from such services is growing, too. 

Since one of the primary motivation behind cloud computing is to make the service easy to use for the client, managing output data should also be carried out by the provider of the service in such a way that is  convenient for the client – it needs to be effective, well-organized and easy to access.

	Relational databases are one way to do so. They are designed and organized especially for rapid search and retrieval in what can be a large amount of data. The database-management systems (DBMS) are a tool for managing and interacting with databases. 
	
	DBMS have several major advantages over the traditional system where data is stored in files. Unlike the file management system, there can be more users accessing the same data concurrently without corrupting the data. Indexing speeds up the data retrieval operations. There is a standardized database language to use for queries. There are mechanisms such as data normalization that can be used to avoid duplicity of data and save storage space.
	
	Being aware of these advantages, the main goal of this thesis is to explore the options of integrating a database storage for output data derived from geoprocessing services. They typically produce geographical data so appropriate software must be used that is capable of dealing with this type of data when using databases (PostGIS).
