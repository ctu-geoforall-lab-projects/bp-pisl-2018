\chapter{Enabling database storage} \label{appendix}
\label{Enabling-database-storage}

To enable the database storage capacity as an author of a process, there are a few things that must be done. No changes are neccessary in the code of the process itself, but configuration file must be updated. 

It is assumed that there is an instance of PostGIS database running on some server.


\section{Configuration file changes} \label{cfgchanges}

When output data is not embedded directly in the response document, there are two more options - it can be stored as a file or in a database. The decision is made based on a value . Therefore, a new option named \texttt{store\_type} must be added in the \texttt{server} section and its value set to \texttt{db}. If the option already exists, only the value must be changed. Position of the option within the \texttt{server} section is arbitrary.

\begin{verbatim}
store_type = db
\end{verbatim}


To connect to a remote database, the following login credentials are required - the name of the database, user name, password and a host (server the database runs on). The \texttt{PgWriter} class is designed to extract them from the configuration file, so the author must add a new section there that contains all the required information. An example of a complete  \texttt{db} section is shown below.

\begin{verbatim} 
[db]  
host=geo102.fsv.cvut.cz
user=pisl
password=XXXXXXXX
dbname=pisl\_bp
\end{verbatim}
